# School-Projects
This shows the school projects that were listed on my resume. I was unable to get the raw files for the Raspberry Pi project listed on my resume, as the Raspberry Pi I used was rented from the school temporarily and I don't have backup copies of the files, but I was able to show the reports that were submitted to my professor, which are word documents and they contain screenshots of all the coding that was done.
